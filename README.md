# ðŸ“š LibraryDB Project (PostgreSQL)

This project is a **Library Management System API** built with **Node.js + TypeScript**.  
It allows you to manage **Authors** and **Books** with simple REST API endpoints.  

You donâ€™t need deep knowledge of Node.js or PostgreSQL to test this project. Just follow the steps below. ðŸš€

---

## ðŸ›  What You Need
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher)
- A tool to test the API:
  - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (recommended for beginners), OR
  - Your web browser / cURL (advanced users)

ðŸ‘‰ PostgreSQL is **not required** in this version because the data is stored **in-memory** (inside the app).  
This means you can test the API immediately after running it, but the data will reset each time you restart.
